   * This does not lead to buggy behavior;
   * Callers provide startKey only if they believe they've received a partial
   * result (that is, if they received a LastEvaluatedKey in a prior response).
   * Since we only perform complete scans, we never send this,
   * so we are never asked for continuations.
   * In any case, the startKey logic in obtainFormsList is uncovered for now.
