    Hello State user,

    We are reaching out to check on the status of your state's FFY[${date.year}]
    Q[${date.quarter}] child enrollment data submission in the Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS).

    FFY[${date.year}] Q[${date.quarter}] reporting of enrollment data to the SEDS was
    due on [${todayDate}]. Our records indicate that [State] has not yet submitted
    the required enrollment data to SEDS at this time. Please let us know when
    we can expect your submission.

    If your state has any other outstanding Quarter(s) of data, please submit
    that information along with your FFY[Fiscal Year] Q[Quarter] data.

    If your state allows retroactive eligibility, the initial enrollment reports will be
    considered preliminary and your state will have the opportunity to submit final reports
    thirty (30) days after the end of the next quarter (with next quarterâ€™s preliminary report).
    The final reports should include information about children whose eligibility was
    retroactive to the earlier quarter.

    If you have any questions,
    please send an email to: MDCTHelp@cms.hss.gov

    Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this message.

    Regards,
    CMS SEDS TA Team.
