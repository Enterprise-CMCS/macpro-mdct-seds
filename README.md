# MACPro Data Collection Tool: CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System

Welcome to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid MACPro Data Collection Tool (MDCT) CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS). MDCT SEDS is a serverless form submission application built and deployed to AWS within the Serverless Application Framwork. Is it based on:

[macpro-quickstart-serverless](https://github.com/CMSgov/macpro-quickstart-serverless) ![Build](https://github.com/CMSgov/macpro-quickstart-serverless/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)[![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cmsgov/macpro-quickstart-serverless.svg)](https://github.com/cmsgov/macpro-quickstart-serverless/releases/latest)

## Architecture

## Git Policies, Activities and Notes

Serverless Name Requirements: A service name should only contain alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. The should start with an alphanumeric character and shouldn't exceed 128 characters.

Please push your code to a new branch with a name that meets the Serverless Name Requirements above. Any other variations and the Github Actions will fail.

After creating a branch, if you need to rename it because it does not follow the rules above, use `git branch -m <new-branch-name>` to rename your local branch then `git push origin -u <new-branch-name>` to rename your remote branch in GitHub.

This project uses a combination of gitflow and serverless naming to handle branches and merging. Branches should be prefixed with the type followed by a descriptive name for the branch. For example:

- master > feature-my-feature-name
- master > bugfix-my-bugfix-name
- master > hotfix-my-hotfix-name

On each PR, a linter and prettier check is run. These checks must pass for a PR to be merged. Prior to submitting your PR, you will need to run the linter and prettier against the work you have done.

- Run Eslint using `yarn lint`
- Run Prettier using `npx prettier --write .`

## Local Dev

From the repository directory, run all the services locally with the command `./dev local`

See the Requirements section if the command asks for any prerequisites you don't have installed.

Local dev is configured in typescript project in `./src`. The entrypoint is `./src/dev.ts`, it manages running the moving pieces locally: the API, the database, the filestore, and the frontend.

Local dev is built around the Serverless plugin [`serverless-offline`](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline). `serverless-offline` runs an API gateway locally configured by `./services/app-api/serverless.yml` and hot reloads your lambdas on every save. The plugins [`serverless-dynamodb-local`](https://github.com/99x/serverless-dynamodb-local) and [`serverless-s3-local`](https://github.com/ar90n/serverless-s3-local) stand up the local db and local s3 in a similar fashion.

When run locally, auth bypasses Cognito. The frontend mimics login in local storage with a mock user and sends an id in the `cognito-identity-id` header on every request. `serverless-offline` expects that and sets it as the cognitoId in the requestContext for your lambdas, just like Cognito would in AWS.

### Adding New Endpoints

1. In `{ROOT}/services/appi-api/serverless.yml`, add new entry to `functions` describing the new endpoint.
   Hint: Make sure your http method is set correctly
   example:

```
functions:
    getUsers:
        handler: handlers/users/list.main
        role: LambdaApiRole
        events:
        - http:
            path: users
            method: get
            cors: true
            authorizer: aws_iam
```

2. Create handler in `{ROOT}/services/app-api/handlers`
   1. Note: For Table name use custom vars located in `{ROOT}/services/app-api/serverless.yml`
   2. Conventions:
      1. Each file in the handler directory should contain a single function called 'main'
      2. The handlers are organized by API, each with their own folder. Within those folders should be separate files for each HTTP verb.
         For instance: There might be `users` folder in handlers, (`app-api/handlers/users`). Within that `users`folder would be individual files each corresponding with an HTTP verb so that the inside of `users` might look like `get.js` `create.js` `update.js` `delete.js`, etc.
         The intention of this structure is that each of the verbs within a folder corresponds to the same data set in the database.
3. Add wrapper function in `{ROOT}/services/ui-src/src/lib/api.js`
   example:

```
export function listUsers() {
  const opts = requestOptions();
  return API.get("amendments", `/users`, opts);
}

### Running the nightwatch test suite

1. Navigate to the front end
   1. `cd services/ui-src`
2. Launch the test for ui-src tests.
   1. Run `yarn run nightwatch src/{dir_name}/tests`
3. Run root tests
   1. In terminal, run `export APPLICATION_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000`
   2. Enter `cd {ROOT}/tests/nightwatch/`
   3. Run `yarn run nightwatch`

### Running Schema Validation

Validate json files against schema to ensure accuracy before each commit.

- Schema Location: `{ROOT}/src/database/schema/`
- Initial Data Location: `{ROOT}/src/database/initial_data_load`

1. Install AJV globally in your environment
   1. `npm install -g ajv-cli`
2. Run validate command
   1. `ajv -s /path/to/schema.json -d /path/to/json.json`

## Requirements

Node - we enforce using a specific version of node, specified in the file `.nvmrc`. This version matches the Lambda runtime. We recommend managing node versions using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Serverless - Get help installing it here: [Serverless Getting Started page](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)

Yarn - in order to install dependencies, you need to [install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

AWS Account: You'll need an AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions (admin recommended) to deploy this app in Amazon.

If you are on a Mac, you should be able to install all the dependencies like so:

```

# install nvm

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash

# select the version specified in .nvmrc

nvm install
nvm use

# install yarn

brew install yarn

# run dev

./dev local
